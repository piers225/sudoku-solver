# sudoku-solver
Very simple sudoku solver program

Uses brute force to find all the solutions for a square of numbers.

This program has no optimisations in, so large grids will probably be slow.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `dotnet run`

The working grids are printed to the console.
